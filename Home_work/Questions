1) You have a file that contains 200 billion URLs. How will you find the first unique URL using Hadoop MapReduce? 


2)The map
output types default to the same types, so they do not need to be set if the mapper
produces the same types as the reducer (as it does in our case). However, if they are
different, the map output types must be set using the setMapOutputKeyClass() and
setMapOutputValueClass() methods. how ?
